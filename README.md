Backtracking:- Backtracking is a very important skill set to solve recursive Solution.
Recursive functions are those that calls itself more than once.
Backtracking is use brust force search approch to solve Problem...
This approch try  to make all possible solution to solve problem. and pick out the best solution.
This rule is also followed by Dynamic programming, but DP is also used to solving optimization Problem..
In CONTRAST backtracking is not used to solving optimization problem.
Backtraking name itself sugest that we  are going back and comming forword, if it is satiesfies the condition then return sucess else we go back again....
